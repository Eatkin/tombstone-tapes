# Tombstone Tapes Homepage

Tombstone Tapes is a business that creates bespoke cassette tapes of 8-bit and 16-bit video games soundtracks, old Windows Operating System soundtracks amongst other novelties.  

The homepage takes inspiration from the past and aims to emulate the look and feel of a Windows 95 PC.  

The page features a fully functional start menu, a real time system clock, and Windows 95 styled windows, buttons and containers.  

It aims to replicate the Windows 95 colour scheme and the start menu items have a restricted 16-bit palette.  

The page also draws some nostalgia from animated gifs of the past, when many people's websites featured these. The gifs are sourced from [GifCities](https://gifcities.org/), an archive of gifs taken from Geocities pages.
